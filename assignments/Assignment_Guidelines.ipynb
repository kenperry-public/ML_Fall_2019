    "    - On the GA's machine, \".\" might be equivalent to `/home/GA/Students/Ken`\n",
    "- The *absolute* path name for a file is a path from the root of the file systems to a file\n",
    "    - e.g., `R:/user/ken/ML_Course/Assignment_1`\n",
    "- The problem with absolute path names for files is that this complete path *probably doesn't exist* on anyone elses machine\n",
    "    - So if your notebook references a file `R:/user/ken/ML_Course/Assignment_1/Data/stock.csv` *it will not run on the GA's machine*\n",
    "- You can reference the same file by a path name that is *relative* to the current directory\n",
    "    - `./Data/stock.csv`\n",
    "    - That is because \".\" on your machine refers to `R:/user/ken/ML_Course/Assignment_1`\n",
    "- But this also means that if the GA copies your entire directory (which you may submit) to a machine where \".\" means `/home/GA/Students/Ken`\n",
    "    - `./Data/stock.csv` will lead to `/home/GA/Students/Ken/Data/stock.csv`\n",
